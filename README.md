Sudoku game as part of the code challenge

9 x 9 sudoku grid with randomly generated puzzles

## Instructions:
1. Click on a cell that you want to fill
2. Type on your keybard the number you want to add

If your input is correct, the inserted number with be green, otherwise it will be red. 

## Requirements:
- Python >= 3.8
- pygame

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies
    ```python3 -m pip install --user pygame```
3. Run the game 
```python3 sudoku.py```

## Next planned implementations
If I would invest more time (than expected/ described in the challenge instructions), I would add proper unit tests to the project. 
The pipeline would include quality gates with:
- linters
- code scanning (vulnerability and dependency checks)
- tests
